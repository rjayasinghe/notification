# notification app

This is a small service modeling a statemachine that handles order events and will send notifications upon different transitions.

## Java Magazin article series

this app is a side-car to the article series "Ein Event-getriebenes System implementieren". The series consists of 3 parts. For each part I created or will create a Git tag so that you can restore the right state of the app for the corresponding article.

`git checkout part_1` for the first part.
`git checkout part_2` for the second part.

...

You get the idea. ;)

## prerequisites

* JDK 11
